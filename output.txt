& Turn #1- Prompt ao

want to create a sliding game using Python that will have a 3x3 board with an empty slot at the bottom corner.
Each piece on the board will represent a part of an image, which will get shuffled. The goal of the game is to
put the image back together by sliding the pieces into place. Each piece can only be moved in 4 directions: up,
down, left and right, in other words it can be swapped with any adjacent piece. For the first draft of the game,
use a number 1-8 on each piece rather than an image. At the start of the game, the pieces should be shown in
order until a "shuffle" button is clicked. At this point the game will start. To move a piece, the user should click
on a tile they want to move, and then click on the place where they want it to go. When they click on a non-
empty tile to move it, the tile should highlight in yellow. The game will end when all numbers are back in order.
